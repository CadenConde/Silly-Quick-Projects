/*
 * EXPLAINATION: Instead of thinking of reflections as bouncing around a
 * single triangle, it is easier to think of it as a single line
 * shooting through a grid of triangles. (like shooting a laser at a
 * mirror, instead of trying to think of how the laser will reflect,
 * just shoot it at the object you want to hit's image in the mirror/
 * think of mirror as window into other room.)
 *
 * Once you visualize the problem like this, you are not longer solving
 * a reflection problem, you are solving a problem about a line
 * intersecting vertices.
 *
 * The number of reflections you want essentially tells you the "row" of
 * the graph, but to get that number, you need to take (bounces + 3) /
 * 2.
 *
 * After you get the row, you have a series of exit points which your
 * line could intersect, but some will hit another vertex before
 * escaping. The way you find how many vertices will be the first chance
 * a laser on a given line to escape has to do with prime number factors
 * or the row #. Euler's Totient Function turns out to be perfect for
 * this case, which is why it appears in the formula. The Totient
 * function gets our answer fairly close, but we need some slight
 * adjustments to avoid double/triple counting
